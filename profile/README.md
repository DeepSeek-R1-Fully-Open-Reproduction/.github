# DeepSeek-R1: Fully Open Reproduction  

**DeepSeek-R1** is an open-source project by Hugging Face that replicates the R1 pipeline for model training, evaluation, and synthetic data generation. This initiative empowers researchers and developers to reproduce and extend cutting-edge AI workflows with no restrictions. Designed for flexibility and scalability, DeepSeek-R1 is a robust framework for advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence research.  

## Key Features  

- **Model Training**:  
   Supports **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** and **Gradient Propagation Reinforcement Optimization (GRPO)** for adapting pre-trained models to specific datasets and tasks.  

- **Evaluation Tools**:  
   Includes benchmarking tools like `lighteval` for assessing model performance on reasoning, math, and code tasks. Compatible with single-GPU and distributed setups for hardware flexibility.  

- **Synthetic Data Generation**:  
   Simplifies generating high-quality synthetic datasets using distilled models. Ideal for creating training data tailored to specific use cases or benchmarks.  

- **Scalability**:  
   Supports distributed training methods like **DeepSpeed ZeRO-2** and **ZeRO-3** as well as configurations for multi-GPU environments, making it suitable for projects of any scale.
